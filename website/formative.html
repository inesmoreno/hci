          We conducted the usability test on Group 6‚Äôs prototype: EasyAsk, Zoom
          built-in function that enables participants to better interact with
          the presenter‚Äôs screen when they are showing a 3D object. Participants
          are able to zoom in and out and point to specific places. Here is a
          link to this group‚Äôs website for more information:
          <a
            href=" http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~jer/courses/hci/project/2020/jiachengyuewang.github.io/ECSE424project/"
            >here!</a
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          To match the user population for which the design is intended, we
          chose to test the prototype on 4 students. Every user had to complete
          8 tasks and for each of these, they were not given any help unless
          they requested it.

            <td id="cell1">High</td>
            <td>
              To be able to use the prototype effectively, many clicks were
              required and unnecessary. For example all notifications (‚ÄòYou‚Äôre
              in the queue‚Äô, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre next‚Äô) had to be clicked on in order to
              continue. This was confusing for subject 1 in task 4, subject 3 in
              task 6 and subject 4 in tasks 4 and 6. <br />
              The notification does not look like a button to be clicked on:
              <img
                src="images/buttons.png"
                class="img-fluid"
                alt="Mental model 2"

            <td>Cursor functionality unimplemented</td>
            <td id="cell1">High</td>
            <td>
              The cursor was not functional in the prototype. Although all
              testers were able to find it, none of them could move it and
              hence, test the design and provide feedback about it.
              Specifically, subject 1 mentioned this on their post-test
              questionnaire.

            <td id="cell1">High</td>
            <td>
              Subject 3 mentioned that they thought it was useless to have a
              queue in order to be able to zoom-in and out the image. If the
              zoomed image is available to everyone once a request is granted,
              it is trivial to have a queue, as everyone will be able to see the
              enlarged image at once.

          <tr>
            <td>Dequeue button too small</td>
            <td id="cell2">Med</td>
            <td>
              When inspecting the queue, users are able to both click on their
              name (which puts them next in queue) or on the cross next to their
              name (to be dequeued). However, this leads to a lot of errors
              since the elements that can be clicked on are relatively small and
              next to each other. For example, it led to an error for subject 3,
              who instead of clicking precisely on the red cross, clicked next
              to it and was brought up to the next task automatically. Subject 2
              also mentioned this in their feedback; for them, after clicking on
              their name to show which position they were at, they were unable
              to come back to dequeue themselves as their action had been
              interpreted as ‚Äòbeing next‚Äô on the queue.

        <h2 class="text-center">3. Test Plan Critique</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          In general, we found fundamental errors with the methodological
          approach that this test employed, which we will discuss in detail
          below. Firstly, the prototype was under developed for the uses of this
          test, with several crucial features missing. The testing materials too
          were underdeveloped and incomplete, as well as misunderstood the
          purpose of the test. Many of the tasks were too procedural and didn‚Äôt
          not capture how users would interact with the app on their own. The
          testing materials were vague and did not connect with standard
          heuristics. Furthermore, the interpretation of the heuristics by the
          group leads us to believe there are misunderstanding of the meaning
          and purpose of HCI heuristics. For all the above reasons, the test
          results are not reliable.

          <h4> Critique of usability goals </h4> <br />
          In general, many of these usability goals measurements are not easy to
          assess nor reliable metrics by which to assess the goal. Furthermore,
          many of the goals here are not present at all in other testing
          materials nor test tasks.

                  There are many ways to interpret ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù;It can be
                  interpreted as frustration, disorientation and comprehension.
                  If confusion means frustration in this context, the perceived
                  level of frustration of each subject after the session could
                  be assessed as a quantitative measurement. If it means
                  disorientation, completion rate and time to completion of each
                  task can be measured. Lastly, if it means one‚Äôs low
                  comprehension level, comprehension questionnaires about the
                  presentation can be completed by subjects.

        <h4> Critiques with testing tasks, procedure, and prototype: </h4> <br />
        In general, many features that should have been tested were not included
        in the test, and features that were tested were implemented in a very
        limited way. Many important aspects of this tool that should have been
        tested were not tested. The testing procedures also left the evaluators
        and participants confused with the application. Specifically:
        <br />

        <ol>
          <li>Presenter version of the application was not tested</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This severely undermines the utility of this testing as one of the
              two core audiences of your application are not assessed at all
            </li>
            <li>
              We were considering doing such testing for you, but we found the
              prototype to be broken for the presenter view and literally no
              testing materials were developed for the presenter version. We
              could not afford to create such testing materials for this
              evaluation.

          <li>Core functionality of the application was not clear</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There was no concise or consistent definition of the core
              functionality of the application, including in the user documents.
              For example, new features of the application are discussed in
              different places. At the very end of the deliverable, the
              usability heuristics mentions ‚ÄúOnce a visualization of an object
              is generated, everyone in the meeting should receive that image
              since others might have the same confusion or they just want to
              have a better view of it.‚Äù This is mentioned literally nowhere
              else in the deliverable, or user documents, or testing documents
              and adds more confusion to the purpose of the application.

            <li>
              Concern is, what if the presenter never notices the easyask queue

          <ul>
            <li>
              This diminishes the value of the testing as zooming in on or
              manipulating a 3D object is very different than a 2d object!
            </li>
            <li>
              We understand it might not be feasible to truly embed a 3D object
              in a prototype. But at the very least an effort could be made to
              simulate rotating an 3rd object just using a handful of 2d images.
              Instead, cursor button wasn‚Äôt even hooked up to any functionality.

              <u>Modification: </u>Implement the ‚Äúmove image using cursor‚Äù
              feature in the prototype. If you are aiming to use this feature
              with 3D models, give the illusion of a 3D model by having several
              2D images of the same object from different perspectives to give a
              feel for this feature. .

              fill out this questionnaire. We chose to ask the participant these
              questions as it made more sense, but seemed to overlap
              significantly with the post test questionnaire

          <ul>
            <li>
              The tasks presented to the testers were very specific and do not
              provide an accurate assessment of the applications utility. Many
              of the tasks were too targeted like ‚Äúclick on the EASYASK icon‚Äù
              then ‚Äúclick on queue yourself‚Äù. This means test results are really
              testing a user‚Äôs ability to follow simple instructions instead of
              testing their ability to use your application more broadly.

        <h4> Critique of usability evaluation : </h4> <br />
        In general the usability evaluation is not captured in the testing
        process and many of the usability heuristics seem deeply misunderstood.
        Furthermore, many of the usability evaluations contradict or are
        misaligned with the usability goals stated earlier. Crucially, the
        usability evaluation does not include metrics by which to assess each
        usability goal in this section. For example, there is no clear
        relationship between post-test questionnaire and the usability
        evaluations. Usability goals also do not clearly align with Nielsen‚Äôs 10
        heuristics.
        <br />
        The following list will specifically analyze each usability evaluation:
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Match between system and the real world</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The evaluation asks users if they felt like they were ‚Äútalking to
              a robot‚Äù. This question does not address the usability heuristic

              What is meant by ‚Äúmatch with the real world‚Äù in this context might
              be the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù experience of seeing an object in a class and
              being able to touch/move it around.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Again, this point seems misinterpreted. The user control and
              freedom refers more to the ability for the user to undo/redo their
              work or easily exit the application at any time. <br />
              It should be noted that users would have like this option, like
              this comment from the post test: ‚ÄúAdd a button to go back when you
              make a mistake and want to undo an action.‚Äù
            </li>
            <li>
              It is a basic assumption that users have the freedom to use or not
              use an application of their choosing. Furthermore, user control
              does not refer to the application controlling other parts of the
              system (as if should be assumed any applications should not
              unnecessarily interfere with other processes on a device).

              I don‚Äôt think this usability goal is addressed in this application
              and this heuristic should be removed (barring changes to the
              application)

          <li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This heuristic is misinterpreted. Flexibility and efficiencies
              refer to accelerators, the ability to do common uses quickly, like
              copy and paste shortcuts.
            </li>
            <li>
              This application does not include this heuristic.

          <li>The system interface should be ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This is not a usability heuristic as defined by Nielsen and using
              ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù in your heuristic is highly discouraged among HCI
              professionals.
            </li>
            <li>
              The description provided of this heuristic sounds more in line
              with the ‚Äúaesthetic and minimalist design‚Äù heuristic as defined by
              Nielsen. Simply changing the title of this heuristic would
              suffice.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            The system should create more interactions between presenters and
            users:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This is great and central to your application.
            </li>
            <li>
              This should have been tested though. It would have been fruitful
              to see if users felt this application facilitated interactions
              between users. A question evaluating this might be: ‚ÄúDid this
              application help you interact with others?‚Äù
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            All audiences should be able to get such a visualization when a

            <li>
              This is not a heuristic. This is a feature or function.

        <br />
        <p>
          A few improvements could be implemented in order to have a better
          design.

          First, there are the pop ups which inform the user that they are in
          the queue and that they‚Äôre up next. However, these pop ups must be
          clicked on in order for the application to proceed, which caused
          considerable confusion in our tests. Subject 4 added themselves to the
          queue and saw the feedback from the system, but didn‚Äôt click on the
          check mark because they assumed that it was a notification. The
          evaluator had to let the testing user know that they had to click on
          the pop up to proceed. This additional interaction could be removed as
          it is not necessary for the functionality of the system and it
          confused the users. The pop up could simply be dismissed automatically
          as a notification after a couple of seconds.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Another observation made by the users is the concept of a queue in
          order to interact and move the model. Subject 3 stated that they
          didn‚Äôt understand why they had to be waiting in line to be able to
          zoom on the model. They commented that they would not actually use the
          system if they had to wait in a queue in order to manipulate the
          model. There was also a lot of confusion around what the model that
          the user would be able to interact with was. The early proposed
          solution was to zoom into the presenter‚Äôs webcam but there was also
          mention of 2D/3D objects. Subject 3 also was unsure whether they were
          zooming in on an image or a slide.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Allowing multiple users to interact with the model at once and
          removing the queue could potentially improve the usability of your
          product as you don‚Äôt need to have extra steps before the system allows
          you to view the model. It was unclear to us whether the interactions
          by the participants with the model were shared with the whole meeting
          or each participant was interacting with it individually. Removing the
          queue and the authorization from the host would especially make sense
          if each participant is able to move around and zoom in and out in
          their own interface. If the viewing of the model is shared with all
          the participants on the video conferencing call, it might be
          interesting to have two modes: one personal and one shared. This way,
          people who do not have questions on the model can still interact with
          it to get a better glimpse of the details without waiting for their
          turn and affecting the other participants in the call.
        </p>
        <br />

          While testing with Subjects 1 and 4, but also in the usability
          evaluation, we observed that users were confused with the flow of your
          system when it is their turn to interact with the model. Users did not
          understand why they had to click on their names to activate their turn
          and this action was also error prone. Subject 3 clicked on their name
          instead of the ‚ùå symbol and they weren‚Äôt able to dequeue themselves.
          Instead, their turn was activated. The system should automatically
          notify the user when it is their turn, if this feature is necessary.
          Instead of displaying a popup with ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up next‚Äù and wait for the
          user to click on the checkmark, you can let them know instead with a
          notification that the system is setting up the model for them to
          interact with it to limit the number of clicks before the participant
          can finally manipulate the object.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The pointer design caused confusion to all users as they were not able
          to interact with it in the computer prototype. It was difficult to
          understand what the black and the red pointing arrows meant, was it
          used to move around the model or to point to a given area of the 3D
          model in order to ask a question? A clearer interface would be
          beneficial for users to understand what the features entail. In your
          documentation you indicate that the users should have the flexibility
          to zoom in on a specific area of the model, but that concept was not
          incorporated into the prototype. Adding a way to specify where the
          user wants to zoom in and out of would help them better interact with
          the model as well as a way to navigate around the displayed area such
          as panning for 2D objects but also rotating for 3D objects.
