This is the repository for the project Group 5 underwent in the context of the HCI (ECSE 424/542) class at McGill University.
Fall 2020 project's theme was: easing the communication burden using videoconferencing tools and our solution was to build Relier, a 
web-app developed that aims to improve the user experience of presenters and participants in a video conferencing environment. 

This software is meant to supplement your video conferencing software of choice. What our application brings to video conferencing 
is the ability for presenters and participants to interact with each other in non-disruptive and casual ways. Our application supports 
communicating emotional expression through the use of emojis and graphics. With our application, we hope you have a more meaningful and 
engaging experience with your video conferences! 

In this repository you will find: 
- The project's notebook reporting on all stages of the design process and deliverables (folder /website)

  This website contains the information about the following deliverables: 
   - Observation and Proposal: Observed users, identified the problem, developed personas, identified use case scenarios, researched and compared existing alternatives and built an architectural diagram of the proposed system. 
   - Low-fidelity Prototype: Sketched design concepts using the 10 plus 10 method, built paper-prototypes, developed usability goals and conducted usability tests using "Wizard of Oz" techniques.
   - High-Fidelity Prototype: Built a computer prototype using Figma, developed user manuals, prepared a usability test procedure, instructions and materials for the evaluating group.
   - Formative Feedback: Were given another group's project to conduct usability testing, heuristic evaluations and provide feedback on their test plan and design. 
   - Alpha System: Based on the feedback received, built the first version of our web-app using React.
   - Beta System: Refined the system based on the feedback received.

It is important to note that this final version is not a ready-for-market product as the effort of this class was to focus on usability rather than functionality.
