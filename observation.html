        <p>
          In order to observe two user groups (presenters and participants), we
          watched different recorded Zoom presentations and generated sticky
          notes about our findings on white board software Miro to define mental
          models. In the same videos, we observed the presenters and
          participants at the same time. To validate our findings, we often
          revisited a particular scene and watched in pairs.

                One of our group members participated in an online webinar
                hosted by a tech company remotely recruiting on campus. The
                webinar had more than 500 participants, 1 presenter (or
                moderator) and 2 guest speakers. The participant cameras and
                microphones were disabled, they were only able to ask questions
                on the chat, but with an overwhelming number of questions,
                sometimes one would ask something that will get lost in the
                chat. The moderator read some selected questions for the guest
                speakers to answer, but sometimes will unintentionally cut one
                another when answering. Furthermore, if one of the guests left
                their microphone on while not speaking, noises in their room
                will interrupt the person speaking and participants attending
                the webinar ‚Äòon speaker‚Äô view will lose the focus on the person
                they were listening to.

          After listing all distinguished tasks on the white boards, we grouped
          them by behavior affinity.

          Presenters struggle to solicit and assess participant engagement and
          responses to presentation. Presenters have been shown to ask (or
          sometimes appear to plead in the instances of educational
          presentations) for participant feedback. Participants that are
          familiar with the presentation do manage to provide feedback through
          unmuting and speaking, messaging in chat, or using features like hand
          raising. Unfortunately, most participants don‚Äôt provide any feedback
          to the presenter and have their camera off, seemingly disengaged. This
          appears to make presenters feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, when
          presenters want to assess participant reaction (for instance by
          reading the chat), it often interrupts their presentation.

            As far as presenters are concerned, they can be grouped by two core
            attributes:<br />
            <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger"
              >prior knowledge of video conferencing</span

          <br />
          <br />

          <h3>Participants</h3>
          Then, we grouped participants into different categories based on two
          core attributes:
          <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">participation</span> and
          <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">focus</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            src="images/att1.png"
            class="img-fluid"
            alt="Mental model 1"
            width="70%"
            height="70%"
          />
          <img

        <br />
        <br />
        In order to keep it manageable within the allotted time frame, we
        selected core groups to focus for this project. For presenters, we
        decided to target those with
        <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">low</span> and
        <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger"
          >medium prior knowledge of video-conferencing tools</span

        , as well as those who look for<span
          class="badge badge-pill badge-danger"
          >high participation</span
        >
        from their audience. For participants, we targeted both
        <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">shy</span> and
        <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">active</span> participants
        that are

        <h2 class="text-center">2. Problem identified</h2>
        <p>
          <br />
          <br>
          The inability for presenters and participants to engage and have
          dialogue with one another is a major issue with video conferencing.
          The lack of low risk, non-disruptive, simple-to-use features that
          allow participants to comfortably engage with presentations results in
          lower levels of engagement. For many presenters, participant
          engagement and reaction serves as a measure of the presentation‚Äôs
          success. Unfortunately, because of the suppressed participant
          reaction, presenters can be made to feel boring and awkward.
          Furthermore, this depression of participation can make participating
          even harder as the norm becomes silence and turned off webcams, making
          speaking up or asking a question all the more intimidating and
          daunting to participants. This lack of engagement is especially
          troublesome for presentations with educational objectives as
          engagement is a necessary component for learning. So far, we have yet
          to find a product that finds a way to support participants' engagement
          and interaction with the presentation.

            Diane is a young professional who is a member of a peer supported
            informal online learning community. A recurring activity in her
            community is a peer-teaching event where different members of the
            community present on a topic of their choosing. Being a PhD student,
            Diane is familiar with teaching and giving presentations as she has
            worked as TA for several years. She recently started giving
            presentations online due to the pandemic but finds presenting online
            is just not the same. Considering video conferencing software, she
            has used Zoom, Skype and facebook video call. Trained to read body
            language and facial expressions, Diane feels like she has no sense
            of how her participants are doing through an online setting. Despite
            her requests for participants to tell her how they‚Äôre following
            along, participants often have their cameras off and only the same
            few people interact with her. Furthermore, every time she tries some
            interactive features like polling or emoji reactions, she struggles
            to set up them up and visualize participant responses, this makes
            her lose time and slows down her presentation. This is a serious
            problem for her and interferes with her teaching ability and
            satisfaction with her work.

            Dakota is a fourth-year university student. They are actively
            looking for job opportunities in business development. Dakota is a
            natural leader and is always willing to be a presenter for the team
            project. They know how to interact with classmates and joke around
            to make their presentation more enjoyable. They also enjoy seeing
            their peers‚Äô reactions to their jokes and comments. As video
            conferencing seems to be the new normal, they want to be more
            familiar with tools to give a presentation that amaze everyone.
            Dakota often imagines themself sitting relaxed, smoothly interacting
            with participants and making them more engaged in the presentation.
            They have tried many video conferencing tools such as Zoom, Skype,
            Google hangout and Duo but are unsatisfied with them.

            Jamie is a long time member of a well respected business convention.
            Jamie has been attending this convention for decades and he is well
            known in this community. The convention Jamie attends has moved
            online recently and it has changed the way Jamie feels about it.
            Before, Jamie loved to see his peers, watch their reactions, and
            participate in lively discussions during business presentations.
            Jamie has no idea how the virtual conference works at this time.
            Although he uses facebook video calls to chat with his children
            living abroad, he has never used video conferencing tools for
            meetings. Jamie is still looking for that lively engagement and
            discussion during presentations. He tries out as many features as
            possible to express his reactions without distracting others during
            the presentation, but is disappointed when he finds out that he is
            the only one participating in this way, or at all.

            online. She has never had an online class before but has watched
            some videos from Cousera and Khan academy while studying in CEGEP.
            During the online class on Zoom, she is often hesitant to jump in
            the discussion and speak as she doesn‚Äôt know anyone in a class yet.
            She sometimes uses the raise hand feature but it is often not
            noticed. Everything is so new and she feels totally unprepared and
            overwhelmed. Most importantly, she usually enjoys actively
            participating in the class and answering questions, but feels way
            too afraid to be put on the spot which prevents her from
            participating.

          <h2 class="text-center">4. Use cases</h2>
          <h5><u>Presenter use case</u></h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In this use case scenario, Diane wants to host an online
              educational presentation for her community.
            </li>
            <li>
              She opens the video conferencing app, logs in using her
              credentials, and starts an online meeting by clicking the ‚ÄúStart
              Meeting‚Äù button.
            </li>
            <li>
              She is presented with a link to the meeting, share it with her
              audience, and waits for people to join.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the participants trickle in, she uses this time to get to know
              her peers by asking some questions, like:
              <i
                >‚ÄúAre you familiar with the presentation topic? Raise your hand
                if yes‚Äù</i
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Now that all the participants have arrived, she starts a quick
              poll about the topic they are covering where participants vote
              using A/B/C/D. She is able to quickly assess their response as the
              results live-tally on screen and reacts accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the more technical phase of the presentation, she notes
              that a lot of participants have anonymously reported they are
              beginning to feel lost. This cues her to slow down and cover the
              material with more details so participants don‚Äôt feel lost.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the end of the presentation, the participants overwhelmingly
              give her clapping emojis and she feels satisfied knowing she did a
              good job!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h5><u>Participant use case</u></h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In this use case scenario, Priscillia is attending one of her
              online classes.
            </li>
            <li>
              She follows the link given by the instructor to attend a class and
              joins the class early.
            </li>
            <li>
              The class already has quite a few students in it, so she doesn‚Äôt
              feel comfortable using their microphone to say ‚ÄòHi‚Äô to the others.
              Instead, she gives a ‚Äúwave‚Äù emoji to signal her presence.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the class is starting, the teacher asks the students to tell
              them how they feel with an anonymous emoji reaction. Priscillia
              knows she is anonymous so she answers honestly with a sleepy face
              emoji. She watches as the live tally of student's emoji reactions
              pour in: many students are responding with a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù, ‚Äúsleepy‚Äù or
              x_x face emoji. She feels a little less alone.
            </li>
            <li>
              The teacher asks review questions covering content in the previous
              class. Again, because the poll is anonymous and the button to
              respond is on the main app interface, she responds.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the discussion of new content, Priscillia begins to feel
              lost. She emotes anonymously that she feels lost and sees the
              tally of lost feeling students increase by one. Soon the number
              begins to climb to about ¬º of the class, so the teacher pauses
              their instruction to solicit clarifying questions from students.
            </li>
            <li>
              Students begin raising their hand and a queue is populated based
              on first come first serve. Priscillia was 3rd to raise her hand so
              she waits for her turn.
            </li>
            <li>
              It turns out that the first question asked is the same as hers, so
              she lowers her hand which automatically removes her from the queue
              of questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              By the end of the class, the professor again asks students to
              anonymously respond with how well they understood that day's
              content with an emoji poll. She responds with a green checkmark.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Due to its high level of security and variety of useful features
            that support educators, Zoom is used as a virtual classroom platform
            in many educational institutions including McGill University. On
            Zoom, students are able to provide feedback to their lecturers via
            emoji and express their reactions by sending a clap or thumbs up.
            Moreover, students can display a ‚Äúraise hand‚Äù icon if they want to
            get permission to speak during the class. These various features of
            Zoom allow students to transform their behavior in off-line class
            into a virtual class so that students are able to feel strong
            telepresence throughout the class.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, these emoji buttons are scattered throughout the software
            which sometimes results in undesired confusion. For example, you can
            express ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù via emoji reactions tab or participants list.
            Users will likely be confused with the differences between the two.
            In addition, emojis reactions are often not noticed by lecturers as
            features like screen sharing often occupies the entire lecturer‚Äôs
            screen. Therefore, students often don‚Äôt get a chance to interact
            with an educator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the current layout of Zoom is poorly designed. Students
            need to manually place windows of participants and chat on their
            screen when needed as Zoom only provides one default layout; chatbox
            on the left corner, participants list on the left top and screen
            shared on the middle. Therefore, on a default layout if a chat box
            is too small due to one‚Äôs laptop size, having a discussion in a chat
            is somewhat challenging.

            Cisco Webex Training offers an easy way of tracking questions and
            documenting responses using a threaded Q&A window as well as
            collecting feedback from the participants through live polling.
            Participants are able to react to the presentation through the
            ‚Äòraise hand‚Äô, ‚Äòyes‚Äô, ‚Äòno‚Äô, ‚Äògo faster‚Äô and ‚Äògo slower‚Äô buttons as

            Furthermore, presenters can track participant‚Äôs attention by using
            the Attention Indicator which shows if a participant has minimized
            the training session window or has brought another window in focus
            on top of the training session window. This is useful for recording

            However, WebEx is slow when connecting to meetings and its video
            quality is lower than Zoom‚Äôs. It also does not have a lot of room
            for customization and only allows to visualize a summary of
            participant‚Äôs yes/no reactions. When reacting with emojis or other
            buttons, the presenter has to check the symbols next to each
            participant‚Äôs name in the list, which is hard to do in a session
            with many participants. Additionally, participants can‚Äôt react

            First, presenters can easily run a poll including yes or no,
            multiple choice or open-ended short answers questions during the
            presentation. The results are visualized right after the poll is
            closed. Students (or meeting participants) can display reactions via
            emoji. Apart from ‚Äúraise hand‚Äù, ‚Äúagree or disagree‚Äù, ‚Äúapplaud‚Äù,
            ‚Äúlaugh‚Äù and ‚Äústep away‚Äù emojis, they also have ‚Äúrequest‚Äù emojis for
            asking educators to ‚Äúspeak louder‚Äù, ‚Äúspeak softer‚Äù, ‚Äúspeed up‚Äù and

            Second, Adobe Connect has a very sophisticated feature to assess
            audience participation. Connect collects and analyses various
            parameters related to participant engagement and provides presenters
            with a real-time aggregate ‚Äúengagement score‚Äù. The Engagement Index
            Calculation uses: chat activity, Q&A activity, poll activity, file
            download, status updates, and other metrics to come up with the
            engagement score.

            Lastly, Adobe Connect provides a different layout depending on the

            However, Adobe Connect is one of the most expensive available
            solutions for web conferencing. For example one of their published
            plans costs 50$ per month and can only host up to 25 participants;
            for bigger meetings (100-1500 participants) the plans start at 130$
            per month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, with the ‚ÄòStatus View‚Äô, hosts can only see the
            reactions of participants that are raising their hands, agreeing,
            disagreeing, or have stepped away. For the remaining reactions and
            requests, the host has to switch to the ‚ÄòParticipant List View‚Äô and
            see the reactions next to each participant name (similar to Zoom).
            Additionally, participants can‚Äôt share their reactions anonimously.

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          One of the main advantages of our proposed system is the ability for
          participants to react and engage in a presentation without garnering
          overwhelming attention and/or being disrupting, while still being
          easily visible to the presenter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Presenters will be able to interpret participant engagement with ease
          through our proposed real time visualization and aggregation of
          participant‚Äôs reactions and responses This eliminates the need for
          presenters to switch to different tabs or change the view mode to
          engage more comfortably with participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, our system is intended to be free and open-source so
          presenters can customize it to their needs and can use it with any
          pre-existing video-conferencing tool without having to spend the extra
          dollars.
        </p>
        <p>The system will benefit our personas in the following ways:</p>
        <p><h5>Diane</h5></p>
        <p>
          As a member of a peer-teaching community, our system will allow her to
          easily visualize her peer‚Äôs reactions when presenting a topic during
          one of their teaching sessions. She will be able to get a sense of how
          many participants are following and assess their reactions easily.
          This way, she can immediately pause and give further explanations when
          the crowd is feeling lost or speed up her presentation if they‚Äôre
          feeling bored. She will be able to visualize all this information on
          the same window preventing her from losing time and/or participant‚Äôs
          attention during interactive exercises.
        </p>
        <p><h5>Dakota</h5></p>
        <p>
          Dakota will be able to interact with their audience with more ease using our software. They will be able to see when participants found their jokes funny, and if they are liking the content they are presenting. They will also be able to poll their audience to make sure they are following their presentation and realize interactive exercises that engage everyone with the content.
        </p>
        <p><h5>Jamie</h5></p>
        <p>
          With our system, Jamie can actively participate in discussions around business presentations, he will be able to raise his hand without having to dig through several menus or drop downs. He won‚Äôt have to interrupt the presentation in order to ask questions and will get a chance to be designated to speak in an orderly manner. Furthermore, he will be able to see other participants' reactions and not feel like he is alone in the presentation.

        </p>
        <p><h5>Priscilla</h5></p>
        <p>
          Finally, Priscilla, the shy student who is afraid of sounding stupid when participating in discussions, and is too shy to giving a wrong answer or asking for clarification when she is lost, will benefit from our system. The ability to anonymously vote in quick polls as well as expressing her feelings and reactions to the presentation without being the center of attention will allow her to participate in low risk ways with the class.

          Our team is composed by one master‚Äôs CS student, one Information
          Studies master student and one fourth-year undergraduate CS student.
          We are all enthusiastic in user-centered design. We have splitted the
          tasks to match each team member's skills while allowing us to work
          collectively and learn from each other in the domains that we feel
          less comfortable.

          We feel confident we will be able to implement at least a prototype of
          this system. In order to minimize technical complications and focus on
          the user design aspect, we plan to implement the features we would
          like to have in a video conferencing system as a stand alone dynamic
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a website prototype is particularly helpful given our collective
          programming experience. All of us (to varying degrees) have experience
          with web development (both front end and back end) and client-server
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure we are on schedule, we have set weekly group meetings (every
          Friday noon) to discuss the progress done, assess next steps, and
          provide each other with support if need be :). We will use GitHub and
          Google Drive to work collaboratively.
