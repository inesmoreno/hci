        <h4 class="text-center">1. Observation</h4>
        <p>
          In order to observe two user groups (presenters and participants), we
          watched different recorded Zoom presentations and generated sticky
          notes about our findings on white board software Miro to define mental
          models. In the same videos, we observed the presenters and
          participants at the same time. To validate our findings, we often
          revisited a particular scene and watched in pairs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Setting: Recorded lecture

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After listing all distinguished tasks on the white boards, we grouped
          them by behavior affinity.

          Presenters struggle to solicit and assess participant engagement and
          responses to presentation. Presenters have been shown to ask (or
          sometimes appear to plead in the instances of educational
          presentations) for participant feedback. Participants that are
          familiar with the presentation do manage to provide feedback through
          unmuting and speaking, messaging in chat, or using features like hand
          raising. Unfortunately, most participants don‚Äôt provide any feedback
          to the presenter and have their camera off, seemingly disengaged. This
          appears to make presenters feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, when
          presenters want to assess participant reaction (for instance by
          reading the chat), it often interrupts their presentation.

          <h3>Presenters</h3>
          <p>
            As far as presenters are concerned, they can be grouped by two core
            attributes:<br />
            <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger"
              >prior knowledge of video conferencing</span

          <br />
          <br />

          <h3>Participants</h3>
          For participants, we can group them into several categories based on
          two core attributes:
          <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">participation</span> and
          <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">focus</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            src="images/att3.png"
            class="img-fluid"
            alt="Mental model 1"
            width="70%"
            height="70%"
          />
          <img

          />
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to keep it manageable within the allotted time frame, we
        selected core groups to focus for this project. For presenters, we
        decided to target those with
        <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">low</span> and
        <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger"
          >medium prior knowledge of video-conferencing tools</span
        >
        , as well as those who look for<span
          class="badge badge-pill badge-danger"
          >high participation</span
        >
        from their audience. For participants, we targeted both
        <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">shy</span> and
        <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">active</span> participants
        that are
        <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success"
          >focused on the presentation.</span

        <h4 class="text-center">2. Problem identified</h4>
        <p>
          <br />
          The inability for presenters and participants to engage and have
          dialogue with one another is a major issue with video conferencing.
          The lack of low risk, non-disruptive, simple-to-use features that
          allow participants to comfortably engage with presentations results in
          lower levels of engagement. For many presenters, participant
          engagement and reaction serves as a measure of the presentation‚Äôs
          success. Unfortunately, because of the suppressed participant
          reaction, presenters can be made to feel boring and awkward.
          Furthermore, this depression of participation can make participating
          even harder as the norm becomes silence and turned off webcams, making
          speaking up or asking a question all the more intimidating and
          daunting to participants. This lack of engagement is especially
          troublesome for presentations with educational objectives as
          engagement is a necessary component for learning. So far, we have yet
          to find a product that finds a way to support participants' engagement
          and interaction with the presentation.

            few people interact with her. This is a serious problem for her and

              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Now that all the participants have arrived, the presenter starts a
              quick poll about the topic they are covering where participants
              vote using A/B/C/D. The presenter is able to quickly assess their
              response as the results live-tally on screen and reacts
              accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the more technical phase of the presentation, the presenter
              notes that a lot of participants have anonymously reported they
              are beginning to feel lost. This cues the presenter to slow down
              and cover the material with more details so participants don‚Äôt
              feel lost.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the end of the presentation, the participants overwhelmingly
              give the presenter clapping emojis and the presenters feels
              satisfied knowing they did a good job!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h5><u>Participants</u></h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The participant follows the link given by the presenter to attend
              a class and joins the class early.
            </li>
            <li>
              The class already has quite a few students in it, so this
              participant doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable using their microphone to say
              ‚ÄòHi‚Äô to the others. Instead, they give a ‚Äúwave‚Äù emoji to signal
              their presence.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the class is starting, the teacher asks the students to tell
              them how they feel with an anonymous emoji reaction. This student
              knows they‚Äôre anonymous so they answer honestly with a sleepy face
              emoji. They watch as the live tally of student's emoji reactions
              pour in: many students are responding with a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù, ‚Äúsleepy‚Äù or
              x_x face emoji. This student feels a little less alone.
            </li>
            <li>
              The teacher asks review questions covering content in the previous
              class. Again, because the poll is anonymous and the button to
              respond is on the main app interface, they respond.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the discussion of new content, the student begins to feel
              lost. They emote anonymously that they feel lost and see the tally
              of lost feeling students increase by one. Soon the number begins
              to climb to about ¬º of the class, so the teacher pauses their
              instruction to solicit clarifying questions from students.
            </li>
            <li>
              Students begin raising their hand and a queue is populated based
              on first come first serve. This student was 3rd to raise their
              hand so they wait for their turn. It turns out that the first
              question asked is the same as theirs, so they lower their hand
              which automatically removes them from the queue of questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              By the end of the class, the professor again asks students to
              anonymously respond with how well they understood that day's
              content with an emoji poll. The student responds with a green
              checkmark.
            </li>

          <h5><u>Zoom</u></h5>
          <p>
            Due to its high level of security and a variety of useful features
            that support educators, Zoom has been used as a virtual classroom
            platform in many educational institutions including McGill
            University. On Zoom, students are able to provide feedback to their
            lecturers via emoji and express their reactions by sending a clap or
            thumbs up. Moreover, students can display a ‚Äúraise hand‚Äù icon if
            they want to get permission to speak during the class. These various
            features of Zoom allow students to transform their behavior in
            off-line class into a virtual class so that students are able to
            feel strong telepresence throughout the class.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, These emoji buttons are scattered on the software so it
            sometimes invites undesired confusion. For example, you can express
            ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù via emoji of reactions tab or participants list. Users
            will likely be confused with the differences between the two. In
            addition, emojis are often not noticed when a shared screen is
            occupied on an educator‚Äôs screen. Therefore, students often don‚Äôt
            get a chance to interact with an educator.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current layout of Zoom is poorly designed. Students need to
            manually place windows of participants and chat on their screen when
            needed as Zoom only provides one default layout; chatbox on the left
            corner, participants list on the left top and screen shared on the
            middle. Therefore, on a default layout if a chat box is too small
            due to one‚Äôs laptop size, having a discussion in a chat is somewhat
            challenging.

          <h5><u>Cisco Webex Training</u></h5>
          <p>
            Cisco Systems also has a video conferencing tool: WebEx, which
            offers a range of useful features for presenters and participants in
            online training sessions such as presentations, webinars or online
            classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, it offers an easy way of tracking questions and documenting
            responses using threaded Q&A as well as collecting feedback from the
            participants through live polling. Participants are also able to
            react to the presentation through the ‚Äòraise hand‚Äô, ‚Äòyes‚Äô, ‚Äòno‚Äô, ‚Äògo
            faster‚Äô and ‚Äògo slower‚Äô buttons as well as express their feelings
            through emojis.

            Furthermore, presenters can track participant‚Äôs attention by using
            the Attention Indicator which shows if a participant has minimized
            the training session window or has brought another window in focus
            on top of the training session window. This is useful for recording
            student‚Äôs participation when teaching remotely.

            However, WebEx is slow in connecting to meetings and its video
            quality is lower than Zoom. It also does not have a lot of room for
            customization and only allows to visualize a summary of
            participant‚Äôs yes/no reactions. When reacting with emojis or other
            buttons, the presenter has to check the symbols next to the
            participant‚Äôs name in the list, which is hard to do in a session
            with many participants. Additionally, participants can‚Äôt react
            anonymously nor is WebEx free to use.

            Adobe has several products in the line of video conferencing tools
            for online meeting, online learning and webinar ; Adobe Connect is
            especially designed for educational settings. Adobe connect has a
            variety of interactive features both for educators and students.

            First, presenters can easily run a poll including yes or no,
            multi-choice or open-ended short answers during the class. And the
            results will be well visualized right after the poll. Students (or
            meeting participants) can display reactions via emoji. Apart from
            ‚Äúraise hand‚Äù, ‚Äúagree or disagree‚Äù, ‚Äúapplaud‚Äù, ‚Äúlaugh‚Äù and ‚Äústep
            away‚Äù emojis, they also have request emojis for asking educators to
            ‚Äúspeak loader‚Äù, ‚Äúspeak softer‚Äù, ‚Äúspeed up‚Äù and ‚Äúspeed down‚Äù.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, Adobe Connect has the most advanced feature to display the
            audience‚Äôs participation. By analysing various interactive
            participation parameters, Adobe Connect shows to educators a score
            in real-time that aggregates the digital body language of
            participants. Engagement Index Calculation includes chat activity,
            Q&A activity, poll activity, file download, status updates, etc.

            Lastly, Adobe Connect provides a different layout depending on the
            purpose of sessions (sharing, discussion, collaboration and
            customized layout). With a single click, Adobe Connect‚Äôs layout is
            automatically adjusted.

          <p>
            However, Adobe Connect is one of the most expensive available
            solutions for web conferencing. For example one of their published
            plans costs 50$ per month and can only host up to 25 participants;
            for bigger meetings (100-1500 participants) the plans start at 130$
            per month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, with the ‚ÄòStatus View‚Äô, hosts can only see the
            reactions of participants that are raising their hands, agreeing,
            disagreeing, or have stepped away. For the remaining reactions and
            request, the host has to switch to the ‚ÄòParticipant List View‚Äô and
            see them next to their names (similar to Zoom). Additionally,
            participants can‚Äôt share their reactions anonimously.

            Other disadvantages of Adobe Connect include its dependency on
            internet bandwidth (when viewing on the browser) or its slowness to
            load (when using the desktop app). Therewith, the interface might be
            fairly complicated for new users.

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          One of the main advantages of the system we are proposing is the
          ability for the participants to react and respond anonymously during a
          presentation, without garnering overwhelming attention and/or
          disrupting the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, we propose an easy visualization of participant‚Äôs
          reactions and responses for the presenters, with no need of switching
          to different tabs, or changing the view mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, our system is intended to be free and open-source so
          presenters can customize it to their needs and can use it with any
          pre-existing video-conferencing tool without having to spend extra
          dollars.
        </p>
        <p>The system will benefit our personas in the following ways:</p>
        <p>
          For Diane, the student member of a peer-teaching community, the system
          will allow her to easily visualize her peer‚Äôs reactions when
          presenting a topic during one of their teaching sessions. She will be
          able to get a sense of how many participants are following and which
          are the reactions to her presentation. That way, she can immediately
          pause and give further explanations when the crowd is feeling lost or
          speed up her presentation if they‚Äôre feeling bored.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Dakota will be able to interact with their audience
          when presenting during class. They will be able to see when
          participants found their jokes funny, and if they are liking the
          content they are presenting. They will also be able to poll their
          audience to make sure they are following their presentation and
          realize interactive exercises that engage everyone with the content.
        </p>
        <p>
          With our system, Jamie (the active convention participant) can
          actively participate in discussions around business presentations, he
          will be able to raise his hand and be sure he gets noticed. He won‚Äôt
          have to interrupt the presentation in order to ask questions and will
          get a chance to be designated to speak in an orderly manner.
          Furthermore, he will be able to see other participants reactions and
          not feel like he is alone in the presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Priscilla, the shy student who is afraid of sounding stupid
          when participating in discussions, giving a wrong answer when asked or
          asking for clarification when she is lost, will benefit from our
          system because she will be able of anonimously vote in quick polls as
          well as expressing her feelings and reacting to the presentation
          without being noticed by other participants and/or the presenter.
