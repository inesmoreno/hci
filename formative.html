          We conducted the usability test on Group 6‚Äôs prototype: EasyAsk, Zoom
          built-in function that enables participants to better interact with
          the presenter‚Äôs screen when they are showing a 3D object. Participants
          are able to zoom in and out and point to specific places. Here is a
          link to this group‚Äôs website for more information:
          <a

          >
          <br />
          <br />
          To match the user population for which the design is intended, we
          chose to test the prototype on 4 students. Every user had to complete
          8 tasks and for each of these, they were not given any help unless
          they requested it.

        <br />
        <p>
          In general, we found fundamental errors with the methodological
          approach that this test employed, which we will discuss in detail
          below. Firstly, the prototype was under developed for the uses of this
          test, with several crucial features missing. The testing materials too
          were underdeveloped and incomplete, as well as misunderstood the
          purpose of the test. Many of the tasks were too procedural and didn‚Äôt
          not capture how users would interact with the app on their own. The
          testing materials were vague and did not connect with standard
          heuristics. Furthermore, the interpretation of the heuristics by the
          group leads us to believe there are misunderstanding of the meaning
          and purpose of HCI heuristics. For all the above reasons, the test
          results are not reliable.

          <u>Critique of usability goals </u> <br />
          In general, many of these usability goals measurements are not easy to
          assess nor reliable metrics by which to assess the goal. Furthermore,
          many of the goals here are not present at all in other testing
          materials nor test tasks.

                  There are many ways to interpret ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù;It can be
                  interpreted as frustration, disorientation and comprehension.
                  If confusion means frustration in this context, the perceived
                  level of frustration of each subject after the session could
                  be assessed as a quantitative measurement. If it means
                  disorientation, completion rate and time to completion of each
                  task can be measured. Lastly, if it means one‚Äôs low
                  comprehension level, comprehension questionnaires about the
                  presentation can be completed by subjects.
