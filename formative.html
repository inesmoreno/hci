          We conducted the usability test on Group 6‚Äôs prototype: EasyAsk, Zoom
          built-in function that enables participants to better interact with
          the presenter‚Äôs screen when they are showing a 3D object. Participants
          are able to zoom in and out and point to specific places. Here is a
          link to this group‚Äôs website for more information:

          <br />
          <br />
          To match the user population for which the design is intended, we
          chose to test the prototype on 4 students. Every user had to complete
          8 tasks and for each of these, they were not given any help unless
          they requested it.
