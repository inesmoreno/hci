          We conducted the usability test on Group 6‚Äôs prototype: EasyAsk, Zoom
          built-in function that enables participants to better interact with
          the presenter‚Äôs screen when they are showing a 3D object. Participants
          are able to zoom in and out and point to specific places. Here is a
          link to this group‚Äôs website for more information:
          <a

            >here!</a
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          To match the user population for which the design is intended, we
          chose to test the prototype on 4 students. Every user had to complete
          8 tasks and for each of these, they were not given any help unless
          they requested it.

        <br />
        <p>
          In general, we found fundamental errors with the methodological
          approach that this test employed, which we will discuss in detail
          below. Firstly, the prototype was under developed for the uses of this
          test, with several crucial features missing. The testing materials too
          were underdeveloped and incomplete, as well as misunderstood the
          purpose of the test. Many of the tasks were too procedural and didn‚Äôt
          not capture how users would interact with the app on their own. The
          testing materials were vague and did not connect with standard
          heuristics. Furthermore, the interpretation of the heuristics by the
          group leads us to believe there are misunderstanding of the meaning
          and purpose of HCI heuristics. For all the above reasons, the test
          results are not reliable.

          <u>Critique of usability goals </u> <br />
          In general, many of these usability goals measurements are not easy to
          assess nor reliable metrics by which to assess the goal. Furthermore,
          many of the goals here are not present at all in other testing
          materials nor test tasks.

                  There are many ways to interpret ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù;It can be
                  interpreted as frustration, disorientation and comprehension.
                  If confusion means frustration in this context, the perceived
                  level of frustration of each subject after the session could
                  be assessed as a quantitative measurement. If it means
                  disorientation, completion rate and time to completion of each
                  task can be measured. Lastly, if it means one‚Äôs low
                  comprehension level, comprehension questionnaires about the
                  presentation can be completed by subjects.

                The usability goal should have been redefined. Instead of simply
                checking whether an image is displayed on each participant‚Äôs
                screen, they could have assessed whether displaying an image on
                everyone‚Äôs screen is disruptive and gathered subject feedback
                from participants. The current usability goal is not testing
                usability but functionality.

        <br />

          A few improvements could be implemented in order to have a better
          design.

          First, there are the pop ups which inform the user that they are in
          the queue and that they‚Äôre up next. However, these pop ups must be
          clicked on in order for the application to proceed, which caused
          considerable confusion in our tests. Subject 4 added themselves to the
          queue and saw the feedback from the system, but didn‚Äôt click on the
          check mark because they assumed that it was a notification. The
          evaluator had to let the testing user know that they had to click on
          the pop up to proceed. This additional interaction could be removed as
          it is not necessary for the functionality of the system and it
          confused the users. The pop up could simply be dismissed automatically
          as a notification after a couple of seconds.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Another observation made by the users is the concept of a queue in
          order to interact and move the model. Subject 3 stated that they
          didn‚Äôt understand why they had to be waiting in line to be able to
          zoom on the model. They commented that they would not actually use the
          system if they had to wait in a queue in order to manipulate the
          model. There was also a lot of confusion around what the model that
          the user would be able to interact with was. The early proposed
          solution was to zoom into the presenter‚Äôs webcam but there was also
          mention of 2D/3D objects. Subject 3 also was unsure whether they were
          zooming in on an image or a slide.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Allowing multiple users to interact with the model at once and
          removing the queue could potentially improve the usability of your
          product as you don‚Äôt need to have extra steps before the system allows
          you to view the model. It was unclear to us whether the interactions
          by the participants with the model were shared with the whole meeting
          or each participant was interacting with it individually. Removing the
          queue and the authorization from the host would especially make sense
          if each participant is able to move around and zoom in and out in
          their own interface. If the viewing of the model is shared with all
          the participants on the video conferencing call, it might be
          interesting to have two modes: one personal and one shared. This way,
          people who do not have questions on the model can still interact with
          it to get a better glimpse of the details without waiting for their
          turn and affecting the other participants in the call.
        </p>
        <br />

          While testing with Subjects 1 and 4, but also in the usability
          evaluation, we observed that users were confused with the flow of your
          system when it is their turn to interact with the model. Users did not
          understand why they had to click on their names to activate their turn
          and this action was also error prone. Subject 3 clicked on their name
          instead of the ‚ùå symbol and they weren‚Äôt able to dequeue themselves.
          Instead, their turn was activated. The system should automatically
          notify the user when it is their turn, if this feature is necessary.
          Instead of displaying a popup with ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up next‚Äù and wait for the
          user to click on the checkmark, you can let them know instead with a
          notification that the system is setting up the model for them to
          interact with it to limit the number of clicks before the participant
          can finally manipulate the object.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pointer design caused confusion to all users as they were not able
          to interact with it in the computer prototype. It was difficult to
          understand what the black and the red pointing arrows meant, was it
          used to move around the model or to point to a given area of the 3D
          model in order to ask a question? A clearer interface would be
          beneficial for users to understand what the features entail. In your
          documentation you indicate that the users should have the flexibility
          to zoom in on a specific area of the model, but that concept was not
          incorporated into the prototype. Adding a way to specify where the
          user wants to zoom in and out of would help them better interact with
          the model as well as a way to navigate around the displayed area such
          as panning for 2D objects but also rotating for 3D objects.
