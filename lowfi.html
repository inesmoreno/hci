        <h4 class="text-center">1. Design Concepts</h4>
        <p>
          Here are the ideas that were generated in our first 10 idea brainstorming session. First, we didn’t constrain the technology feasibility and the layout of our possible designs, rather we explored all possible design options.

      <br />
      <br />
        <p>
          After this session, we settled on a single column interface which doesn’t incorporate video conferencing tools because we wanted our system to be used by anyone, no matter their choice of video-conferencing platform. From that, we generated many ideas about the structure and format of this program, namely where key features like raising hand or emoting would go. Here are the ideas we came up with:

        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/sketch4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Mental model 2" />
        <br />
        <br />
     
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4 class="text-center">2. Prototypes</h4>
        <p>
          <br />
          We bounced our ideas off each other with sketches  and conducted usability testing with our paper prototypes. For the usability testing, we ran the wizard of Oz testing as below:

        <br />
        <br />
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Design decisions</h3>
        Having worked on our sketches and prototypes, we made several design decisions. 
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Not to incorporate videoconferencing in our website.</li>
          <ul><li>In order to make our system accessible to everyone, we decided not to integrate it into any existing video-conferencing platform. Rather, we opted to create a stand-alone web app that can be opened in a separate window and positioned next to the video conferencing software. That way, our system can be used by anyone, no matter their choice of video-conferencing platform. This will also help us in terms of feasibility as we will not have to deal with complicated code bases and integrating our features with existing platforms like Zoom. </li></ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li> Vertical display </li>
          <ul>
            <li>We chose a vertical display as it is easy to organize our features from top to bottom while sharing the screen real estate with a video conferencing software. This also facilitates displaying on tablets or phones if users decide to use those instead of having two different windows open. </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Integrate chat feature</li>
          <ul>
            <li>At first, we were debating whether we should create a chat feature in our app, or rely on the user video conferencing platform’s chat feature. We ultimately decided to add a chat feature to our application. Having chat functionality in our app means that users don’t need to continually go back to the video conferencing software they use. Having a chat feature rounds out our application and provides more of a “one stop” app that meets more use cases. </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Toggle display for aggregate emoji reacts
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>We were unsure if we should show aggregated emoji responses as a raw number beside the respective emoji, or as a bar graph histogram of emoji responses. Instead of choosing between these two views, we decided to give users the option to toggle between both views (number score and bar graph). This way users can adjust the display of the app in a way that works best for them.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Express participant level of understanding on a 2D line + visualize it in a distribution 
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>When it comes to the “level of understanding” feature that aggregates how participants self report their understanding of the presentation content, we chose to have users input their level of understanding as a point on a spectrum and display the class aggregate as a distribution. For participants, articulating their understanding on a spectrum opposed to discrete emoji allows for more precise expression on the part of the participant. Displaying the aggregated level of understanding, we opted for a distribution as this will make it easier for the presenter to draw conclusions from the data, as he will be able to see in real-time how the ‘level of understanding’ trend for the audience moves when they make further explanations or present new topics. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Display participant position in questions queue  </li>
          <ul><li>Regarding the “hand raising” queue populated by participants raising their hand, we chose to not show participants the names of the other participants in the queue. Instead, we decided to simply display the number of participants with their hand up, and if the participant raised their hand, what position they are in the queue. We did this to declutter the UI. We thought the position in the queue would be helpful as students can anticipate when they will be called on to ask their question to the presenter and provide a fair (first come, first serve) order to questions.</li></ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Polling with emoji
              </li>
            <ul><li>Most polling features in video conferencing software opens a new popup window. We decided to have an integrated poll feature embedded directly in the interface. We chose this because our observation findings showed us pop up windows can be distracting and annoying to users. </li>
            <li>We also decided to reuse the “reactions” panel that displays popular participant reactions to display polling answers. This means students vote with an emoji (ex 🅰, 🅱) and class aggregates are displayed in the reactions panel. This is better than a dedicated polling panel for two reasons: it saves space, and allows participants to express “I don’t know” or “thinking” emojis while answering. These latter emoji reactions are particularly valuable to a presenter. </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

            Diane is a young professional who is a member of a peer supported
            informal online learning community. A recurring activity in her
            community is a peer-teaching event where different members of the
            community present on a topic of their choosing. Being a PhD student,
            Diane is familiar with teaching and giving presentations as she has
            worked as TA for several years. She recently started giving
            presentations online due to the pandemic but finds presenting online
            is just not the same. Considering video conferencing software, she
            has used Zoom, Skype and facebook video call. Trained to read body
            language and facial expressions, Diane feels like she has no sense
            of how her participants are doing through an online setting. Despite
            her requests for participants to tell her how they’re following
            along, participants often have their cameras off and only the same
            few people interact with her. Furthermore, every time she tries some
            interactive features like polling or emoji reactions, she struggles
            to set up them up and visualize participant responses, this makes
            her lose time and slows down her presentation. This is a serious
            problem for her and interferes with her teaching ability and
            satisfaction with her work.

            Dakota is a fourth-year university student. They are actively
            looking for job opportunities in business development. Dakota is a
            natural leader and is always willing to be a presenter for the team
            project. They know how to interact with classmates and joke around
            to make their presentation more enjoyable. They also enjoy seeing
            their peers’ reactions to their jokes and comments. As video
            conferencing seems to be the new normal, they want to be more
            familiar with tools to give a presentation that amaze everyone.
            Dakota often imagines themself sitting relaxed, smoothly interacting
            with participants and making them more engaged in the presentation.
            They have tried many video conferencing tools such as Zoom, Skype,
            Google hangout and Duo but are unsatisfied with them.

            Jamie is a long time member of a well respected business convention.
            Jamie has been attending this convention for decades and he is well
            known in this community. The convention Jamie attends has moved
            online recently and it has changed the way Jamie feels about it.
            Before, Jamie loved to see his peers, watch their reactions, and
            participate in lively discussions during business presentations.
            Jamie has no idea how the virtual conference works at this time.
            Although he uses facebook video calls to chat with his children
            living abroad, he has never used video conferencing tools for
            meetings. Jamie is still looking for that lively engagement and
            discussion during presentations. He tries out as many features as
            possible to express his reactions without distracting others during
            the presentation, but is disappointed when he finds out that he is
            the only one participating in this way, or at all.

            Priscillia is a first-year university student. She was so excited to
            meet new friends and learn the topic she is interested in at
            University, then the pandemic happened and all classes were moved to
            online. She has never had an online class before but has watched
            some videos from Cousera and Khan academy while studying in CEGEP.
            During the online class on Zoom, she is often hesitant to jump in
            the discussion and speak as she doesn’t know anyone in a class yet.
            She sometimes uses the raise hand feature but it is often not
            noticed. Everything is so new and she feels totally unprepared and
            overwhelmed. Most importantly, she usually enjoys actively
            participating in the class and answering questions, but feels way
            too afraid to be put on the spot which prevents her from
            participating.

            <li>
              In this use case scenario, Diane wants to host an online
              educational presentation for her community.
            </li>
            <li>
              She opens the video conferencing app, logs in using her
              credentials, and starts an online meeting by clicking the “Start
              Meeting” button.
            </li>
            <li>
              She is presented with a link to the meeting, share it with her
              audience, and waits for people to join.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the participants trickle in, she uses this time to get to know
              her peers by asking some questions, like:
              <i
                >“Are you familiar with the presentation topic? Raise your hand
                if yes”</i

            </li>
            <li>
              Now that all the participants have arrived, she starts a quick
              poll about the topic they are covering where participants vote
              using A/B/C/D. She is able to quickly assess their response as the
              results live-tally on screen and reacts accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the more technical phase of the presentation, she notes
              that a lot of participants have anonymously reported they are
              beginning to feel lost. This cues her to slow down and cover the
              material with more details so participants don’t feel lost.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the end of the presentation, the participants overwhelmingly
              give her clapping emojis and she feels satisfied knowing she did a
              good job!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h5><u>Participant use case</u></h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In this use case scenario, Priscillia is attending one of her
              online classes.
            </li>
            <li>
              She follows the link given by the instructor to attend a class and
              joins the class early.
            </li>
            <li>
              The class already has quite a few students in it, so she doesn’t
              feel comfortable using their microphone to say ‘Hi’ to the others.
              Instead, she gives a “wave” emoji to signal her presence.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the class is starting, the teacher asks the students to tell
              them how they feel with an anonymous emoji reaction. Priscillia
              knows she is anonymous so she answers honestly with a sleepy face
              emoji. She watches as the live tally of student's emoji reactions
              pour in: many students are responding with a “meh”, “sleepy” or
              x_x face emoji. She feels a little less alone.
            </li>
            <li>
              The teacher asks review questions covering content in the previous
              class. Again, because the poll is anonymous and the button to
              respond is on the main app interface, she responds.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the discussion of new content, Priscillia begins to feel
              lost. She emotes anonymously that she feels lost and sees the
              tally of lost feeling students increase by one. Soon the number
              begins to climb to about ¼ of the class, so the teacher pauses
              their instruction to solicit clarifying questions from students.
            </li>
            <li>
              Students begin raising their hand and a queue is populated based
              on first come first serve. Priscillia was 3rd to raise her hand so
              she waits for her turn.
            </li>
            <li>
              It turns out that the first question asked is the same as hers, so
              she lowers her hand which automatically removes her from the queue
              of questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              By the end of the class, the professor again asks students to
              anonymously respond with how well they understood that day's
              content with an emoji poll. She responds with a green checkmark.
            </li>

          </h5>
          <p>
            Due to its high level of security and variety of useful features
            that support educators, Zoom is used as a virtual classroom platform
            in many educational institutions including McGill University. On
            Zoom, students are able to provide feedback to their lecturers via
            emoji and express their reactions by sending a clap or thumbs up.
            Moreover, students can display a “raise hand” icon if they want to
            get permission to speak during the class. These various features of
            Zoom allow students to transform their behavior in off-line class
            into a virtual class so that students are able to feel strong
            telepresence throughout the class.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, these emoji buttons are scattered throughout the software
            which sometimes results in undesired confusion. For example, you can
            express “thumbs up” via emoji reactions tab or participants list.
            Users will likely be confused with the differences between the two.
            In addition, emojis reactions are often not noticed by lecturers as
            features like screen sharing often occupies the entire lecturer’s
            screen. Therefore, students often don’t get a chance to interact
            with an educator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the current layout of Zoom is poorly designed. Students
            need to manually place windows of participants and chat on their
            screen when needed as Zoom only provides one default layout; chatbox
            on the left corner, participants list on the left top and screen
            shared on the middle. Therefore, on a default layout if a chat box
            is too small due to one’s laptop size, having a discussion in a chat
            is somewhat challenging.

            Cisco Systems also has a video conferencing tool: WebEx, which
            offers a range of useful features for presenters and participants in
            online training sessions such as presentations, webinars or online
            classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cisco Webex Training offers an easy way of tracking questions and
            documenting responses using a threaded Q&A window as well as
            collecting feedback from the participants through live polling.
            Participants are able to react to the presentation through the
            ‘raise hand’, ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘go faster’ and ‘go slower’ buttons as
            well as express their feelings through emojis.

            Furthermore, presenters can track participant’s attention by using
            the Attention Indicator which shows if a participant has minimized
            the training session window or has brought another window in focus
            on top of the training session window. This is useful for recording
            student’s participation when teaching remotely.

            However, WebEx is slow when connecting to meetings and its video
            quality is lower than Zoom’s. It also does not have a lot of room
            for customization and only allows to visualize a summary of
            participant’s yes/no reactions. When reacting with emojis or other
            buttons, the presenter has to check the symbols next to each
            participant’s name in the list, which is hard to do in a session
            with many participants. Additionally, participants can’t react
            anonymously and WebEx isn’t free to use.

            Adobe has several video conferencing products for online meetings,

            First, presenters can easily run a poll including yes or no,
            multiple choice or open-ended short answers questions during the
            presentation. The results are visualized right after the poll is
            closed. Students (or meeting participants) can display reactions via
            emoji. Apart from “raise hand”, “agree or disagree”, “applaud”,
            “laugh” and “step away” emojis, they also have “request” emojis for
            asking educators to “speak louder”, “speak softer”, “speed up” and
            “speed down”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, Adobe Connect has a very sophisticated feature to assess
            audience participation. Connect collects and analyses various
            parameters related to participant engagement and provides presenters
            with a real-time aggregate “engagement score”. The Engagement Index
            Calculation uses: chat activity, Q&A activity, poll activity, file
            download, status updates, and other metrics to come up with the
            engagement score.

            Lastly, Adobe Connect provides a different layout depending on the
            purpose of sessions (sharing, discussion, collaboration and
            customized layout). With a single click, Adobe Connect’s layout is
            automatically adjusted.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Adobe Connect is one of the most expensive available
            solutions for web conferencing. For example one of their published
            plans costs 50$ per month and can only host up to 25 participants;
            for bigger meetings (100-1500 participants) the plans start at 130$
            per month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, with the ‘Status View’, hosts can only see the
            reactions of participants that are raising their hands, agreeing,
            disagreeing, or have stepped away. For the remaining reactions and
            requests, the host has to switch to the ‘Participant List View’ and
            see the reactions next to each participant name (similar to Zoom).
            Additionally, participants can’t share their reactions anonimously.

            Other disadvantages of Adobe Connect include its dependency on
            internet bandwidth (when viewing on the browser) or its slowness to
            load (when using the desktop app). Therewith, the interface might be
            fairly complicated for new users.

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          One of the main advantages of our proposed system is the ability for
          participants to react and engage in a presentation without garnering
          overwhelming attention and/or being disrupting, while still being
          easily visible to the presenter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Presenters will be able to interpret participant engagement with ease
          through our proposed real time visualization and aggregation of
          participant’s reactions and responses This eliminates the need for
          presenters to switch to different tabs or change the view mode to
          engage more comfortably with participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, our system is intended to be free and open-source so
          presenters can customize it to their needs and can use it with any
          pre-existing video-conferencing tool without having to spend the extra
          dollars.
        </p>
        <p>The system will benefit our personas in the following ways:</p>
        <p><h5>Diane</h5></p>
        <p>
          As a member of a peer-teaching community, our system will allow her to
          easily visualize her peer’s reactions when presenting a topic during
          one of their teaching sessions. She will be able to get a sense of how
          many participants are following and assess their reactions easily.
          This way, she can immediately pause and give further explanations when
          the crowd is feeling lost or speed up her presentation if they’re
          feeling bored. She will be able to visualize all this information on
          the same window preventing her from losing time and/or participant’s
          attention during interactive exercises.
        </p>
        <p><h5>Dakota</h5></p>
        <p>
          Dakota will be able to interact with their audience with more ease using our software. They will be able to see when participants found their jokes funny, and if they are liking the content they are presenting. They will also be able to poll their audience to make sure they are following their presentation and realize interactive exercises that engage everyone with the content.
        </p>
        <p><h5>Jamie</h5></p>
        <p>
          With our system, Jamie can actively participate in discussions around business presentations, he will be able to raise his hand without having to dig through several menus or drop downs. He won’t have to interrupt the presentation in order to ask questions and will get a chance to be designated to speak in an orderly manner. Furthermore, he will be able to see other participants' reactions and not feel like he is alone in the presentation. 

        </p>
        <p><h5>Priscilla</h5></p>
        <p>
          Finally, Priscilla, the shy student who is afraid of sounding stupid when participating in discussions, and is too shy to giving a wrong answer or asking for clarification when she is lost, will benefit from our system. The ability to anonymously vote in quick polls as well as expressing her feelings and reactions to the presentation without being the center of attention will allow her to participate in low risk ways with the class.

        <p>
          We feel confident we will be able to implement at least a prototype of
          this system. In order to minimize technical complications and focus on
          the user design aspect, we plan to implement the features we would
          like to have in a video conferencing system as a stand alone dynamic
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a website prototype is particularly helpful given our collective
          programming experience. All of us (to varying degrees) have experience
          with web development (both front end and back end) and client-server
          applications.

          To ensure we are on schedule, we have set weekly group meetings (every
          Friday noon) to discuss the progress done, assess next steps, and
          provide each other with support if need be :). We will use GitHub and
          Google Drive to work collaboratively.
