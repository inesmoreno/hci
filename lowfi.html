        <p>
          Here are the ideas that were generated in our first 10 idea
          brainstorming session. First, we didn‚Äôt constrain the technology
          feasibility and the layout of our possible designs, rather we explored
          all possible design options.

        <p>
          After this session, we settled on a single column interface which
          doesn‚Äôt incorporate video conferencing tools because we wanted our
          system to be used by anyone, no matter their choice of
          video-conferencing platform. From that, we generated many ideas about
          the structure and format of this program, namely where key features
          like raising hand or emoting would go. Here are the ideas we came up
          with:

            We bounced our ideas off each other with sketches and conducted
            usability testing with our paper prototypes. For the usability
            testing, we ran the wizard of Oz testing as below:

            <h4 class="text-center">Design decisions</h4>
            Having worked on our sketches and prototypes, we made several design
            decisions.
            <br />
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>
               <u>  Not to incorporate videoconferencing in our website. </u>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In order to make our system accessible to everyone, we
                    decided not to integrate it into any existing
                    video-conferencing platform. Rather, we opted to create a
                    stand-alone web app that can be opened in a separate window
                    and positioned next to the video conferencing software. That
                    way, our system can be used by anyone, no matter their
                    choice of video-conferencing platform. This will also help
                    us in terms of feasibility as we will not have to deal with
                    complicated code bases and integrating our features with
                    existing platforms like Zoom.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
               <u>Vertical display </u> 
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We chose a vertical display as it is easy to organize our
                    features from top to bottom while sharing the screen real
                    estate with a video conferencing software. This also
                    facilitates displaying on tablets or phones if users decide
                    to use those instead of having two different windows open.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
               <u>Integrate chat feature </u> 
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    At first, we were debating whether we should create a chat
                    feature in our app, or rely on the user video conferencing
                    platform‚Äôs chat feature. We ultimately decided to add a chat
                    feature to our application. Having chat functionality in our
                    app means that users don‚Äôt need to continually go back to
                    the video conferencing software they use. Having a chat
                    feature rounds out our application and provides more of a
                    ‚Äúone stop‚Äù app that meets more use cases.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
               <u> Toggle display for aggregate emoji reacts </u>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We were unsure if we should show aggregated emoji responses
                    as a raw number beside the respective emoji, or as a bar
                    graph histogram of emoji responses. Instead of choosing
                    between these two views, we decided to give users the option
                    to toggle between both views (number score and bar graph).
                    This way users can adjust the display of the app in a way
                    that works best for them.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
               <u>  Express participant level of understanding on a 2D line +
                visualize it in a distribution </u>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When it comes to the ‚Äúlevel of understanding‚Äù feature that
                    aggregates how participants self report their understanding
                    of the presentation content, we chose to have users input
                    their level of understanding as a point on a spectrum and
                    display the class aggregate as a distribution. For
                    participants, articulating their understanding on a spectrum
                    opposed to discrete emoji allows for more precise expression
                    on the part of the participant. Displaying the aggregated
                    level of understanding, we opted for a distribution as this
                    will make it easier for the presenter to draw conclusions
                    from the data, as he will be able to see in real-time how
                    the ‚Äòlevel of understanding‚Äô trend for the audience moves
                    when they make further explanations or present new topics.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
              <u> Display participant position in questions queue </u> 
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Regarding the ‚Äúhand raising‚Äù queue populated by participants
                    raising their hand, we chose to not show participants the
                    names of the other participants in the queue. Instead, we
                    decided to simply display the number of participants with
                    their hand up, and if the participant raised their hand,
                    what position they are in the queue. We did this to
                    declutter the UI. We thought the position in the queue would
                    be helpful as students can anticipate when they will be
                    called on to ask their question to the presenter and provide
                    a fair (first come, first serve) order to questions.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
               <u> Polling with emoji </u> 
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Most polling features in video conferencing software opens a
                    new popup window. We decided to have an integrated poll
                    feature embedded directly in the interface. We chose this
                    because our observation findings showed us pop up windows
                    can be distracting and annoying to users.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We also decided to reuse the ‚Äúreactions‚Äù panel that displays
                    popular participant reactions to display polling answers.
                    This means students vote with an emoji (ex üÖ∞, üÖ±) and class
                    aggregates are displayed in the reactions panel. This is
                    better than a dedicated polling panel for two reasons: it
                    saves space, and allows participants to express ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt
                    know‚Äù or ‚Äúthinking‚Äù emojis while answering. These latter
                    emoji reactions are particularly valuable to a presenter.
